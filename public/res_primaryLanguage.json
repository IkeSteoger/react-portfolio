A reliable leader that loves to see growth with the ability to adapt in difficult situations. Entertainer with a background in life broadcasting. Both industries have taught me much about critical thinking, rolling with the punches, problem solving, and to never stop trying to gain more knowledge! You never can know everything, even after a decade+ in the same industry! I built my first PC in 2012 and have built 10+ for friends and family.
