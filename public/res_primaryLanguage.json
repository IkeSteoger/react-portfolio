A reliable leader that loves to see growth with the ability to adapt in difficult situations. Entertainer with a background in life broadcasting. Both industries have taught me much about critical thinking, rolling with the punches, problem solving, and to never stop trying to gain more knowledge! You never can know everything, even after a decade+ in the same industry! I built my first PC in 2012 and have built 10+ for friends and family. Tech lover who finally is making the jump into the field & learning everything that fits into my brain!",

The idea is to have an app that allows kids to go through the website on their own and discover a few different pathways of interactivity such as: a splash page with a question of picking their favorite color and having the page show up as that color, clicking on a picture that links them to their favorite videos, a separate page for to a physics based game, and a rewards/progress tracker so that they can view what they've done the next time they access the website!",
